<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

this project handles the task of classifying the Bills in the Kneset,
As of current time , only Israel_Law DB was manually classified (approx 1400 entries), into approx 48 categories
using those entries , i've trained a NaiveBayes ML classifier to identify those categories of 



### Built With
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
* [XML](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html)


## Getting Started
  (1) download XML files from the Knesset Odata repository using MergeXML.py , which downloads by increments of 100 entries per xml file , then merges them to one big xml
 
 (2) given the big XML , run the appropriate XMLtoCSV_{}.py   to convert the xml into CSV with the relevant data
 
    (a)  person(i.e knesset member)
    
    (b)  Bill_Initiator
    
    (c)  Israeli_laws
    
    (d)  Classification
    
 (3) for Knesset_Bills :
 
    (a) run bill_download.py , which downloads the bill doc from odata service in .doc format
    
    (b) run from cmd "rename *.doc *.docx" to convert to docx format
    
    (c) run docx_to_txt.py to convert the docx files to txt files.
 
 (4) for israel_laws:
 
    (a) run download_law, which:
    
        (*) creates dictionary including only law_ids who have classification
        
        (*) manipulate the dicitonary so each key (i.e law_id) has an array of classifications (52 possible classifications)
        
        (*) creates csv called attempt_to_manipuate_law with 52 possible classifications
        
        (*) attempt to download classified law context from open knesset wiki as those are not available in odata service.
        
        (*) create csv called file.csv with 52 possible classifications , only for laws who has classification and were sucessfully downloaded from the open knesset wiki
        
    (b) run parse_law.py which removes metadata info added by the open knesset website when downloading from there.
    
 
 (5) run ML_Classification.py on the israel_law_post_parse folder generated by (4):

    and on file.csv also generated in part (4).
    
    use those to train the NaiveBayes algorithem.
    
    we actually train 52 seperate classifiers, 1 for each category.
    
    then, for each bill extracted by (3) , we run each of the 52 classifiers to receive classifications for each bill.
    
    final result  is displayed in 
    
    bill_with_categories.csv


### run

 in order to run and classify the code, you dont need 70 % of these files.
 all that is requiered is the following :
 the file.csv , containing israel_law_id and their classification/
 the ML_classification.py , containing the code to create classifiers if needed, and run the classifcations on un-classified files/directories. 
 the more_plot.py to produce statistics on the sucess\failure of the classifier
 and the classifiers directory ,containing all 52 binary classifiers, thus no need to train new classifiers ,only to run existing classifiers on un-classified files/directories
