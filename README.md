## About The Project

this project handles the task of classifying the Bills in the Kneset,
As of current time , only Israel_Law DB was manually classified (approx 1400 entries), into approx 48 categories
using those entries , i've trained a NaiveBayes ML classifier to identify those categories of 



### Built With
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
* [XML](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html)


## Getting Started
  (1) download XML files from the Knesset Odata repository using MergeXML.py , which downloads by increments of 100 entries per xml file , then merges them to one big xml
 
 (2) given the big XML , run the appropriate XMLtoCSV_{}.py   to convert the xml into CSV with the relevant data
    (a)  person(i.e knesset member)
    (b)  Bill_Initiator
    (c)  Israeli_laws
    (d)  Classification
    
 (3) for Knesset_Bills :
    (a) run bill_download.py , which downloads the bill doc from odata service in .doc format
    (b) run from cmd "rename *.doc *.docx" to convert to docx format
    (c) run docx_to_txt.py to convert the docx files to txt files.
 
 (4) for israel_laws:
    (a) run download_law, which:
    
        (*) creates dictionary including only law_ids who have classification
        
        (*) manipulate the dicitonary so each key (i.e law_id) has an array of classifications (52 possible classifications)
        
        (*) creates csv called attempt_to_manipuate_law with 52 possible classifications
        
        (*) attempt to download classified law context from open knesset wiki as those are not available in odata service.
        
        (*) create csv called file.csv with 52 possible classifications , only for laws who has classification and were sucessfully downloaded from the open knesset wiki
        
    (b) run parse_law.py which removes metadata info added by the open knesset website when downloading from there.
    
 
 5) run ML_Classification.py on the israel_law_post_parse folder generated by (4) ,
 
    and on file.csv also generated in part (4).
    
    use those to train the NaiveBayes algorithem.
    
    we actually train 52 seperate classifiers, 1 for each category.
    
    then, for each bill extracted by (3) , we run each of the 52 classifiers to receive classifications for each bill.
    
    final result  is displayed in 
    
    bill_with_categories.csv
